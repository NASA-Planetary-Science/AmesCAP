# Installing the Community Analysis Pipeline (CAP)

### Welcome!

This document contains the instructions for installing the NASA Ames MCMC's Community Analysis Pipeline (CAP).

Installing CAP is fairly straightforward. We will create a Python virtual environment, download CAP, and then install CAP in the virtual environment. That's it!

A quick overview of what is covered in this installation document:

1. [Creating the Virtual Environment](#1-creating-the-virtual-environment)
2. [Installing CAP](#2-installing-cap)
3. [Testing & Using CAP](#3-testing-using-cap)
4. [Practical Tips](#4-practical-tips-for-later-use-during-the-tutorial)

## 1. Creating the Virtual Environment

We begin by creating a virtual environment in which to install CAP. The virtual environment is an isolated Python environment cloned from an existing Python distribution. The virtual environment consists of the same directory trees as the original environment, but it includes activation and deactivation scripts that are used to move in and out of the virtual environment. Here's an illustration of how the two Python environments might differ:

```
     anaconda3                    virtual_env3/
     ├── bin                      ├── bin
     │   ├── pip       (copy)     │    ├── pip
     │   └── python3    >>>>      │    ├── python3
     └── lib                      │    ├── activate
                                  │    ├── activate.csh
                                  │    └── deactivate
                                  └── lib             

  ORIGINAL ENVIRONMENT           VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
      (untouched)            (vanishes when deactivated)
```

We can install and upgrade packages in the virtual environment without breaking the main Python environment. In fact, it is safe to change or even completely delete the virtual environment without breaking the main distribution. This allows us to experiment freely in the virtual environment, making it the perfect location for installing and testing CAP.




***

### Step 1: Identify Your Preferred Python Distribution

If you are already comfortable with Python's package management system, you are welcome to install the pipeline on top any python**3** distribution already present on your computer. Jump to Step #2 and resolve any missing package dependency.

For all other users, we highly recommend using the latest version of the Anaconda Python distribution. It ships with pre-compiled math and plotting packages such as `numpy` and `matplotlib` as well as pre-compiled libraries like `hdf5` headers for reading `netCDF` files (the preferred filetype for analysing MGCM output).

You can install the Anaconda Python distribution via the command-line or using a [graphical interface](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (scroll to the very bottom of the page for all download options). You can install Anaconda at either the `System/` level or the `User/` level (the later does not require admin-priviledges). The instructions below are for the **command-line installation** and installs Anaconda in your **home directory**, which is the recommended location. Open a terminal and type the following:

```bash
(local)>$ chmod +x Anaconda3-2021.05-MacOSX-x86_64.sh   # make the .sh file executable (actual name may differ)
(local)>$ ./Anaconda3-2021.05MacOSX-x86_64.sh           # runs the executable
```

Which will return:

```bash
> Welcome to Anaconda3 2021.05
>
> In order to continue the installation process, please review the license agreement.
> Please, press ENTER to continue
> >>>
```

Read (`ENTER`) and accept (`yes`) the terms, choose your installation location, and initialize Anaconda3:

```bash
(local)>$ [ENTER]
> Do you accept the license terms? [yes|no]
> >>>
(local)>$ yes
> Anaconda3 will now be installed into this location:
> /Users/username/anaconda3
>
>  - Press ENTER to confirm the location
>  - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
>  - Or specify a different location below
>
> [/Users/username/anaconda3] >>>
(local)>$ [ENTER]
> PREFIX=/Users/username/anaconda3
> Unpacking payload ...
> Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json):
>   done                                                       
> Solving environment: done
>
> ## Package Plan ##
> ...
> Preparing transaction: done
> Executing transaction: -
> done
> installation finished.
> Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init? [yes|no]
> [yes] >>>
(local)>$ yes
```

> For Windows users, we recommend installing the pipeline in a Linux-type environment using [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). This will enable the use of CAP command line tools. Simply download the Windows version of Anaconda on the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) and follow the instructions from the installation GUI. When asked about the installation location, make sure you install Python under your emulated-Linux home directory (`/home/username`) and ***not*** in the default location (`/cygdrive/c/Users/username/anaconda3`). From the installation GUI, the path you want to select is something like: `C:/Program Files/cygwin64/home/username/anaconda3`. Also be sure to check **YES** when prompted to "Add Anaconda to my `PATH` environment variable."

Confirm that your path to the Anaconda Python distribution is fully actualized by closing out of the current terminal, opening a new terminal, and typing:

```bash
(local)>$ python[TAB]
```

If this returns multiple options (e.g. `python`, `python2`, `python 3.7`, `python.exe`), then you have more than one version of Python sitting on your system (an old `python2` executable located in `/usr/local/bin/python`, for example). You can see what these versions are by typing:

```bash
(local)>$ python3 --version     # Linux/MacOS
(local)>$ python.exe --version  # Cygwin/Windows
```

Check your version of `pip` the same way, then find and set your `$PATH` environment variable to point to the Anaconda Python *and* Anaconda  pip distributions. If you are planning to use Python for other projects, you can update these paths like so:

```bash
# with bash:
(local)>$ echo 'export PATH=/Users/username/anaconda3/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
# with csh/tsch:
(local)>$ echo 'setenv PATH $PATH\:/Users/username/anaconda3/bin\:$HOME/bin\:.'  >> ~/.cshrc
```

Confirm these settings using the `which` command:

```bash
(local)>$ which python3         # Linux/MacOS
(local)>$ which python.exe      # Cygwin/Windows
```

which hopefully returns a Python executable that looks like **it was installed with Anaconda**, such as:

```bash
> /username/anaconda3/bin/python3     # Linux/MacOS
> /username/anaconda3/python.exe      # Cygwin/Windows
```

If `which` points to either of those locations, you are good to go and you can proceed from here using the shorthand path to your Anaconda Python distribution:

```bash
(local)>$ python3     # Linux/MacOS
(local)>$ python.exe  # Cygwin/Windows
```

If, however, `which` points to some other location, such as `/usr/local/bin/python`, or more than one location, proceed from here using the **full** path to the Anaconda Python distribution:

```bash
(local)>$ /username/anaconda3/bin/python3 # Linux/MacOS
(local)>$ /username/anaconda3/python.exe  # Cygwin/Windows
```




***

### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment:

Python virtual environments are created from the command line. Create an environment called `AmesCAP` by typing:

```bash
(local)>$ python3 -m venv --system-site-packages AmesCAP    # Linux/MacOS Use FULL PATH to python if needed
(local)>$ python.exe -m venv –-system-site-packages AmesCAP  # Cygwin/Windows Use FULL PATH to python if needed
```

First, find out if your terminal is using *bash* or a variation of *C-shell* (*.csh*, *.tsch*...) by typing:

```bash
(local)>$ echo $0
> -bash
```

Depending on the answer, you can now activate the virtual environment with one of the options below:

```bash
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/bin/activate          # bash
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/bin/activate.csh      # csh/tcsh
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/Scripts/activate.csh  # Cygwin/Windows
(local)>$ conda AmesCAP/bin/activate           # if you used conda
```

> In Cygwin/Windows, the `/bin` directory may be named `/Scripts`.

You will notice that after sourcing `AmesCAP`, your prompt changed indicate that you are now *inside* the virtual environment (i.e. `(local)>$ ` changed to `(AmesCAP)>$`).

We can verify that `which python` and `which pip` unambiguously point to `AmesCAP/bin/python3` and `AmesCAP/bin/pip`, respectively, by calling `which` within the virtual environment:

```bash
(AmesCAP)>$ which python3         # in bash, csh
> AmesCAP/bin/python3
(AmesCAP)>$ which pip
> AmesCAP/bin/pip

(AmesCAP)>$ which python.exe      # in Cygwin/Windows
> AmesCAP/Scripts/python.exe
(AmesCAP)>$ which pip
> AmesCAP/Scripts/pip            
```

There is therefore no need to reference the full paths while **inside** the virtual environment.

## 2. Installing CAP

### Using `pip`

Open a terminal window, activate the virtual environment, and untar the file or install from the github:

```bash
(local)>$ source ~/AmesCAP/bin/activate          # bash
(local)>$ source ~/AmesCAP/bin/activate.csh      # cshr/tsch
(local)>$ source ~/AmesCAP/Scripts/activate.csh  #  Cygwin/Windows
(local)>$ conda AmesCAP/bin/activate             # if you used conda


(AmesCAP)>$ pip install git+https://github.com/NASA-Planetary-Science/AmesCAP.git
```
> Please follow the instructions to upgrade pip if recommended during that steps. Instructions relevant the *conda* package manager are listed at the end of this section



That's it! CAP is installed in `AmesCAP` and you can see the `MarsXXXX.py` executables stored in `~/AmesCAP/bin/`:

```bash
(local)>$ ls ~/AmesCAP/bin/
> Activate.ps1     MarsPull.py      activate.csh              nc4tonc3         pip3
> MarsFiles.py     MarsVars.py      activate.fish             ncinfo           pip3.8
> MarsInterp.py    MarsViewer.py    easy_install              normalizer       python
> MarsPlot.py      activate         easy_install-3.8          pip              python3
```


Double check that the paths to the executables are correctly set in your terminal by exiting the virtual environment:

```bash
(AmesCAP)>$ deactivate
```

then reactivating the virtual environment:

```bash
(local)>$ source ~/AmesCAP/bin/activate          # bash
(local)>$ source ~/AmesCAP/bin/activate.csh      # csh/tsch
(local)>$ source ~/AmesCAP/Scripts/activate.csh  # cygwin
(local)>$ conda AmesCAP/bin/activate             # if you used conda
```

and checking the documentation for any CAP executable using the `--help` option:

```bash
(AmesCAP)>$ MarsPlot.py --help
(AmesCAP)>$ MarsPlot.py -h
```

or using **full** paths:

```bash
(AmesCAP)>$ ~/AmesCAP/bin/MarsPlot.py -h     # Linux/MacOS
(AmesCAP)>$ ~/AmesCAP/Scripts/MarsPlot.py -h # Cygwin/Windows
```

If the pipeline is installed correctly, `--help` will display documentation and command-line arguments for `MarsPlot` in the terminal.

> If you have either purposely or accidentally installed the `AmesCAP` package on top of your main python distribution (e.g. in `~/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/` or `~/anaconda3/bin/`) BEFORE setting-up the `AmesCAP` virtual environment, the `Mars*.py` executables may not be present in the `~/AmesCAP/bin/` directory of the virtual environment (`~/AmesCAP/Scripts/` on Cygwin). Because on Step 2 we created the virtual environment using the `--system-site-packages` flag, python will consider that `AmesCAP` is already installed when creating the new virtual environment and pull the code from that location, which may change the structure of the `~/AmesCAP/bin` directory within the virtual environment. If that is the case, the recommended approach is to exit the virtual environment (`deactivate`), run `pip uninstall AmesCAP` to remove CAP from the main python distribution, and start over at Step 2.

This completes the one-time installation of CAP in your virtual environment, `AmesCAP`, which now looks like:

```

```

### Using `conda`

If you prefer using the `conda` package manager for setting up your virtual environment instead of `pip`, you may use the following commands to install CAP.

First, verify (using `conda info` or `which conda`) that you are using the intented `conda` executable (two or more versions of `conda` might be present if both Python2 and Python3 are installed on your system). Then, create the virtual environment with:

```bash
(local)>$ conda create -n AmesCAP
```

Activate the virtual environment, then install CAP:

```bash
(local)>$ conda activate AmesCAP
(AmesCAP)>$ conda install pip
(AmesCAP)>$ pip install git+https://github.com/NASA-Planetary-Science/AmesCAP.git
```

The source code will be installed in:

```bash
/path/to/anaconda3/envs/AmesCAP/
```

and the virtual environment may be activated and deactivated with `conda`:

```bash
(local)>$ conda activate AmesCAP
(AmesCAP)>$ conda deactivate
(local)>$
```


> **Note:** CAP requires the following Python packages, which were automatically installed with CAP:
> ```bash
> matplotlib        # the MatPlotLib plotting library
> numpy             # math library
> scipy             # math library and input/output for fortran binaries
> netCDF4 Python    # handling netCDF files
> requests          # downloading GCM output from the MCMC Data Portal
> ```



***

### Removing CAP

To permanently remove CAP, activate the virtual environment and run the `uninstall` command:

```bash
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/bin/activate          # bash
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/bin/activate.csh      # csh/tcsh
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/Scripts/activate.csh  # Cygwin/Windows
(AmesCAP)>$ pip uninstall AmesCAP
```

You may also delete the `AmesCAP` virtual environment directory at any time. This will uninstall CAP, remove the virtual environment from your machine, and will not affect your main Python distribution.


***

## 3. Testing & Using CAP

Whenever you want to use CAP, simply activate the virtual environment and all of CAP's executables will be accessible from the command line:

```bash
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/bin/activate          #   bash
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/bin/activate.csh      #   csh/tcsh
(local)>$ source AmesCAP/Scripts/activate.csh  #   Cygwin/Windows
```

You can check that the tools are installed properly by typing `Mars` and then pressing the **TAB** key. No matter where you are on your system, you should see the following pop up:

```bash
(AmesCAP)>$ Mars[TAB]
> MarsFiles.py   MarsInterp.py  MarsPlot.py    MarsPull.py    MarsVars.py
```

If no executables show up then the paths have not been properly set in the virtual environment. You can either use the full paths to the executables:

```bash
(AmesCAP)>$ ~/AmesCAP/bin/MarsPlot.py
```

Or set up aliases in your `./bashrc` or `.cshrc`:

```bash
# with bash:
(local)>$ echo alias MarsPlot='/Users/username/AmesCAP/bin/MarsPlot.py' >> ~/.bashrc
(local)>$ source ~/.bashrc

# with csh/tsch
(local)>$ echo alias MarsPlot /username/AmesCAP/bin/MarsPlot >> ~/.cshrc
(local)>$ source ~/.cshrc
```

## 4. Practical Tips for Later Use During the Tutorial



### Install `ghostscript` to Create Multiple-Page PDFs When Using `MarsPlot`

Installing `ghostscript` on your local machine allows CAP to generate a multiple-page PDF file instead of several individual PNGs when creating several plots. Without `ghostcript`, CAP defaults to generating multiple `.png` files instead of a single PDF file, and we therefore strongly recommend installing `ghostscript` to streamline the plotting process.


First, check whether you already have `ghostscript` on your machine. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
(local)>$ gs -version
> GPL Ghostscript 9.54.0 (2021-03-30)
> Copyright (C) 2021 Artifex Software, Inc.  All rights reserved.
```

If `ghostscript` is not installed, follow the directions on the `ghostscript` [website](https://www.ghostscript.com/download.html) to install it.
> If `gs -version` returns a 'command not found error' but you are able to locate the `gs` executable  on your system (e.g. /opt/local/bin/gs) you may need to add that specific directory (e.g. /opt/local/bin/) to your search $PATH as done for Python and pip in Step 1



### Enable Syntax Highlighting for the Plot Template

The `MarsPlot` executable requires an input template with the `.in` file extension. We recommend using a text editor that provides language-specific (Python) syntax highlighting to make keywords more readable. A few options include: [Atom](https://atom.io/) and vim (compatible with MacOS, Windows, Linux), notepad++ (compatible with Windows), or gedit (compatible with Linux).

The most commonly used text editor is vim. Enabling proper syntax-highlighting for Python in **vim** can be done by adding the following lines to `~/.vimrc`:

```bash
syntax on
colorscheme default
au BufReadPost *.in  set syntax=python
```
