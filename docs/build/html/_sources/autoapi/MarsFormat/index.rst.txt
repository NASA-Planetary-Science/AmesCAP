:py:mod:`MarsFormat`
====================

.. py:module:: MarsFormat

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   The MarsFormat executable is a routine that transforms non-MGCM model
   output into MGCM-like model output for compatibility with CAP. 

   MarsFormat changes variable names, dimension names, dimension order,
   and units to the configuration expected by CAP. In some cases, such as
   for MarsWRF, variables are derived and regridded onto a standard grid.

   The executable requires x arguments:
       * [-openmars --openmars]    convert openMars data to MGCM format
       * [-marswrf --marswrf]      convert MarsWRF data to MGCM format
       

   Third-party Requirements:
       * numpy
       * argparse
       * xarray

   List of Functions:
       * x

   MarsFormat.openmars_to_mgcm



.. py:function:: marswrf_to_mgcm(DS)

   Converts variables in MarsWRF output files to MGCM-like format and
   derives variables from their perturbations.

   WRF data is output to dimensions: [time, pfull, lat, lon] or 
   [t,z,y,x], just like MGCM data. Some WRF variables are on staggered
   grids, referred to in the comments using ' (prime; like y').

   The dimensions of the native WRF variables can be:
   - t  = time             (like time in MGCM)
   - z  = bottom_top       (like pfull in MGCM)
   - z' = bottom_top_stag  (like phalf in MGCM)
   - y  = south_north      (like lat in MGCM)
   - y' = south_north_stag
   - x  = west_east        (like lon in MGCM)
   - x' = west_east_stag  

   The variables transferred or derived from WRF output and piped to
   the MGCM daily file are listed below.

   Parameters
   ----------
   DS : xarray dataset
       The dataset created by xarray when it opens the user-supplied
       input file.

   Returns
   -------
   var_dict : dictionary
       Dictionary with variable names as keys and a list of attributes[values, dimensions, longname, units] as values.
   time : array
       Minutes since simulation start
   lat : array
       Latitude on a regular grid
   lon : array
       Longitude on a regular grid
   phalf : array
       Half pressure levels
   pfull : array
       Full pressure levels


.. py:function:: openmars_to_mgcm(DS)

   Converts variables in openMars output files to MGCM-like format.

   openMars data is similar to MGCM data already. This function derives
   pfull and phalf but otherwise only needs to rename variables and 
   update units, longnames, and dimensions to match MGCM output.

   Parameters
   ----------
   DS : xarray dataset
       The dataset created by xarray when it opens the user-supplied
       input file.

   Returns
   -------
   var_dict : dictionary
       Dictionary with variable names as keys and a list of attributes[values, dimensions, longname, units] as values.
   time : array
       Minutes since simulation start
   lat : array
       Latitude on a regular grid
   lon : array
       Longitude on a regular grid
   phalf : array
       Half pressure levels
   pfull : array
       Full pressure levels
