## Welcome to the Mars Climate Modeling Center (MCMC) Community Analysis Pipeline (CAP).

CAP is a set of Python 3 libraries and command-line executables that streamline the downloading, processing and plotting modeling outputs from the NASA Ames Mars Climate Models. At the moment, both the NASA Ames Legacy GCM (Global Climate Model) and the NASA Ames GCM with the GFDL's FV3 dynamical core are supported.

Please check the [tutorial/](./tutorial/) directory for:

* Detailed installation instructions for Linux, MacOS, Windows [Step-by-Step Installation](./tutorial/CAP_Install.md)
* A lecture presenting the functionalities of the CAP [Introduction to CAP and Documentation of its Functions](./tutorial/CAP_lecture.md)
* Two sets of practice exercises to get familiar with CAP for the [NASA Ames MGCM](./tutorial/CAP_Exercises.md) and the [Legacy GCM outputs](./tutorial/CAP_Exercises_2021.md)

The tutorial uses outputs from MGCM simulations extensively documented in [Haberle et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103518305761) and available for download on the [MCMC Data Portal](https://data.nas.nasa.gov/mcmc/index.html)
