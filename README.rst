Welcome to the Mars Climate Modeling Center (MCMC) **Community Analysis Pipeline (CAP)**.

**CAP** is a set of Python3 libraries and command-line executables that streamline downloading, processing, and plotting output from the NASA Ames Mars Global Climate Models: the NASA Ames Legacy Mars GCM and the NASA Ames Mars GCM.

Please see  directory for:

* Installation instructions for Linux, MacOS, and Windows
* Documentation for CAP functions
* A set of exercises to get familiar with CAP

MGCM output is extensively documented in `Haberle et al. 2019 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103518305761>`_.
